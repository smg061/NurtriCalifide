For our Project we created a health based website. Our website provides the user with nutritional meals recipes as well as a link to restaurants that would provide "cheat meals". When the user signs in, they are presented with Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner columns. In each tab they can view recipes or meal options. The web appliction also includes a calendar.
